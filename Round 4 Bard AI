Prompt 4:
What is the net present value of the following annual cash flows at 10% interest: -1000, 1200, 1200,1200,1200,1200?

Response 4:
The net present value (NPV) of the following annual cash flows at 10% interest is $3548.94.

The code above calculates the NPV by first calculating the present value of each cash flow using the formula:

present_value = cash_flow / (1 + discount_rate)**n
where:

cash_flow is the cash flow in a given year
n is the number of years in the future the cash flow is received
discount_rate is the interest rate
The present values of all the cash flows are then summed to get the NPV.

In this case, the NPV is $3548.94. This means that the present value of the future cash flows is greater than the initial investment of $1000, so the project is worth undertaking.
